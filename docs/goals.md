### Goals

The gsuite APIs are powerful, but can have a high barrier to entry. 
There are also nuances to the specific formats of each one which make it
hard to consistently interact with them.
Several existing packages exist for specific tools. Pygsuite
is designed to apply a consistent API across all gsuite offerings.
